# ML4SAR-Tutorial
This tutorial approaches Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as one more data modality to be integrated into Machine Learning applications, in contrast to traditional SAR-specific tutorials. The focus is on preparing SAR data to be ML-ready, with a clear goal of making it accessible for machine learning workflows.
